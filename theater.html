        <h1>Darren Ross does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h3>The Three Sisters Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p>CHEBUTIKIN. [Angrily] Devil take them all... take them all.... They
            think I'm a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely
            nothing, I've forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely
            nothing. [OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him] Devil take it. Last
            Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip--and she died, and it's my fault
            that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount five-and-twenty
            years ago, but I don't remember anything now. Nothing. Perhaps I'm not
            really a man, and am only pretending that I've got arms and legs and a
            head; perhaps I don't exist at all, and only imagine that I walk, and
            eat, and sleep. [Cries] Oh, if only I didn't exist! [Stops crying;
            angrily] The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were talking
            in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I'd never read, never
            read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so did the
            others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the woman
            I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn't get her out of my mind, and
            everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went and
            drank....
            
            [IRINA, VERSHININ and TUZENBACH enter; TUZENBACH is wearing new and
            fashionable civilian clothes.]
            
            IRINA. Let's sit down here. Nobody will come in here.
            
            VERSHININ. The whole town would have been destroyed if it hadn't been
            for the soldiers. Good men! [Rubs his hands appreciatively] Splendid
            people! Oh, what a fine lot!
            
            KULIGIN. [Coming up to him] What's the time?
            
            TUZENBACH. It's past three now. It's dawning.
            
            IRINA. They are all sitting in the dining-room, nobody is going. And
            that Soleni of yours is sitting there. [To CHEBUTIKIN] Hadn't you better
            be going to sleep, doctor?
            
            CHEBUTIKIN. It's all right... thank you.... [Combs his beard.]
            
            KULIGIN. [Laughs] Speaking's a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch!
            [Pats him on the shoulder] Good man! _In vino veritas_, the ancients
            used to say.
            
            TUZENBACH. They keep on asking me to get up a concert in aid of the
            sufferers.
            
            IRINA. As if one could do anything....
            
            TUZENBACH. It might be arranged, if necessary. In my opinion Maria
            Sergeyevna is an excellent pianist.
            
            KULIGIN. Yes, excellent!</p>
