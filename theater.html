    <h4 class="chebutikin">CHEBUTIKIN.</h4>
    <p class="direction">[Angrily]</p>
    <p class="speech">Devil take them all... take them all.... They
        think I'm a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely
        nothing, I've forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely
        nothing.
    <p class="direction">[OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him]</p>
    <p class="speech">Devil take it. Last
        Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip--and she died, and it's my fault
        that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount five-and-twenty
        years ago, but I don't remember anything now. Nothing. Perhaps I'm not
        really a man, and am only pretending that I've got arms and legs and a
        head; perhaps I don't exist at all, and only imagine that I walk, and
        eat, and sleep.</p>
    <p class="direction">[Cries]</p>
    <p class="speech">Oh, if only I didn't exist!</p>
    <p class="direction">[Stops crying;
        angrily]</p>
    <p class="speech">The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were talking
        in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I'd never read, never
        read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so did the
        others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the woman
        I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn't get her out of my mind, and
        everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went and
        drank....</p>

    <p class="direction">[IRINA, VERSHININ and TUZENBACH enter; TUZENBACH is wearing new and
        fashionable civilian clothes.]</p>

    <h4 class="irina">IRINA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">Let's sit down here. Nobody will come in here.</p>

    <h4 class="vershinin">VERSHININ.</h4>
    <p class="speech">The whole town would have been destroyed if it hadn't been
        for the soldiers. Good men!</p>
    <p class="direction">[Rubs his hands appreciatively]</p>
    <p class="speech">Splendid people! Oh, what a fine lot!</p>

    <h4 class="kuligin">KULIGIN.</h4>
    <p class="direction">[Coming up to him]</p>
    <p class="speech">What's the time?</p>

    <h4 class="tuzenbach">TUZENBACH.</h4>
    <p class="speech">It's past three now. It's dawning.</p>

    <h4 class="irina">IRINA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">They are all sitting in the dining-room, nobody is going. And
        that Soleni of yours is sitting there.</p>
    <p class="direction">[To CHEBUTIKIN]</p>
    <p class="speech">Hadn't you better be going to sleep, doctor?</p>

    <h4 class="chebutikin">CHEBUTIKIN.</h4>
    <p class="speech">It's all right... thank you....</p>
    <p class="direction">[Combs his beard.]</p>

    <h4 class="kuligin">KULIGIN.</h4>
    <p class="direction">[Laughs]</p>
    <p class="speech">Speaking's a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch!
    <p class="direction">[Pats him on the shoulder]</p>
    <p class="speech">Good man! _In vino veritas_, the ancients used to say.</p>

    <h4 class="tuzenbach">TUZENBACH.</h4>
    <p class="speech">They keep on asking me to get up a concert in aid of the
        sufferers.</p>

    <h4 class="irina">IRINA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">As if one could do anything....</p>

    <h4 class="tuzenbach">TUZENBACH.</h4>
    <p class="speech">It might be arranged, if necessary. In my opinion Maria
        Sergeyevna is an excellent pianist.</p>

    <h4 class="kuligin">KULIGIN.</h4>
    <p class="speech">Yes, excellent!</p>
