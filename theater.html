        <h1>Darren Ross does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h3>The Three Sisters Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p><h4>CHEBUTIKIN.</h4> <p>[Angrily]</p> <p>Devil take them all... take them all.... They
            think I'm a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely
            nothing, I've forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely
            nothing. <p>[OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him]</p> Devil take it. Last
            Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip--and she died, and it's my fault
            that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount five-and-twenty
            years ago, but I don't remember anything now. Nothing. Perhaps I'm not
            really a man, and am only pretending that I've got arms and legs and a
            head; perhaps I don't exist at all, and only imagine that I walk, and
            eat, and sleep. <p>[Cries]</p> Oh, if only I didn't exist! <p>[Stops crying;
            angrily]</p> The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were talking
            in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I'd never read, never
            read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so did the
            others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the woman
            I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn't get her out of my mind, and
            everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went and
            drank....</p>
            
            <p>[IRINA, VERSHININ and TUZENBACH enter; TUZENBACH is wearing new and
            fashionable civilian clothes.]</p>
            
            <h4>IRINA.</h4> Let's sit down here. Nobody will come in here.
            
            <h4>VERSHININ.</h4> <p>The whole town would have been destroyed if it hadn't been
            for the soldiers. Good men! <p>[Rubs his hands appreciatively]</p> Splendid
            people! Oh, what a fine lot!</p>
            
            <h4>KULIGIN.</h4> <p>[Coming up to him]</p> What's the time?
            
            <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> It's past three now. It's dawning.
            
            <h4>IRINA.</h4> <p>They are all sitting in the dining-room, nobody is going. And
            that Soleni of yours is sitting there. <p>[To CHEBUTIKIN]</p> Hadn't you better
            be going to sleep, doctor?</p>
            
            <h4>CHEBUTIKIN.</h4> It's all right... thank you.... <p>[Combs his beard.]</p>
            
            <h4>KULIGIN.</h4> <p>[Laughs]</p> <p>Speaking's a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch!
            <p>[Pats him on the shoulder]</p> Good man! _In vino veritas_, the ancients
            used to say.</p>
            
            <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p>They keep on asking me to get up a concert in aid of the
            sufferers.</p>
            
            <h4>IRINA.</h4> As if one could do anything....
            
            <h4>TUZENBACH.</h4> <p>It might be arranged, if necessary. In my opinion Maria
            Sergeyevna is an excellent pianist.</p>
            
            <h4>KULIGIN.</h4> Yes, excellent!</p>
