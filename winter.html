        or four.</p>

    <p class="name">TUZENBACH.</p>
    <p class="speech">In this town absolutely nobody understands music, not a soul
        except myself, but I do understand it, and assure you on my word of
        honour that Maria Sergeyevna plays excellently, almost with genius.</p>

    <p class="name">KULIGIN.</p>
    <p class="speech">You are right, Baron, I'm awfully fond of Masha. She's very
        fine.</p>
